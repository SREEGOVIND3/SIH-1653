## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

#### **1. AI-Powered Candidate Profiling and Skill Mapping**  
**AI-Powered Candidate Profiling and Skill Mapping**: Use AI to create detailed profiles of candidates by analyzing their resumes, past projects, and online portfolios. Map their skills to the job requirements. Integrate AI algorithms to extract and analyze data from resumes, GitHub profiles, and LinkedIn. Generate a skill matrix that highlights the candidate’s strengths and areas for improvement. Provide interviewers with a pre-interview report summarizing the candidate’s expertise. This helps interviewers ask more targeted questions and ensures a better match between the candidate’s skills and the job role.

#### **2. Emotion and Sentiment Analysis During Interviews**  
**Emotion and Sentiment Analysis During Interviews**: Use AI to analyze the candidate’s emotions and sentiments during the interview to gauge confidence, clarity, and stress levels. Integrate emotion recognition AI using facial expression analysis and voice tone detection. Provide real-time feedback to interviewers on the candidate’s emotional state. Include sentiment analysis of responses to assess positivity, confidence, and relevance. This adds an additional layer of evaluation, helping to identify candidates who perform well under pressure.

#### **3. Blockchain-Based Document Verification**  
**Blockchain-Based Document Verification**: Use blockchain technology to securely verify and store candidate documents, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud. Create a blockchain-based system for uploading and verifying documents like degrees, certificates, and IDs. Allow interviewers and admins to access verified documents instantly. Ensure tamper-proof storage and easy sharing of documents across departments. This enhances trust and transparency in the recruitment process while reducing manual verification efforts.  

---

#### **4. Interactive Scenario-Based Assessments**  
**Interactive Scenario-Based Assessments**: Introduce interactive, scenario-based assessments to evaluate problem-solving and decision-making skills. Develop web-based simulations of real-world challenges relevant to DRDO’s scientific and managerial roles. Allow candidates to interact with the scenarios and make decisions in real-time. Evaluate responses based on creativity, logic, and alignment with DRDO’s objectives. This provides a deeper understanding of the candidate’s practical skills and thought processes.  

---

#### **5. Multilingual Support for Diverse Candidates**  
**Multilingual Support for Diverse Candidates**: Provide multilingual support to cater to candidates from diverse linguistic backgrounds. Integrate a language translation API (e.g., Google Translate) to support multiple languages. Allow candidates to take interviews in their preferred language. Provide real-time translation of questions and responses for interviewers. This makes the interview process more inclusive and accessible, attracting a wider pool of talent.  

--- 

### **Conclusion**  
These innovative ideas leverage advanced technologies like AI, blockchain, and multilingual support to enhance the DRDO interview process. By focusing on skill mapping, emotion analysis, document security, scenario-based assessments, and inclusivity, these solutions ensure a comprehensive, fair, and efficient recruitment process that aligns with DRDO’s mission to identify the best scientific and managerial talent.
